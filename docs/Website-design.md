## Screenshots of 4 website designs that are inspiring 

1. www.usf.edu
  * I like the clean look of this Universities' webpage. Many of the other University webpages linked to FESC's webpage in the footer were confusing and cluttered. 
  * Large main Picture which encompasses the website's main purpose. Navigation bar is clearly presented at the top of the page, and the footer included relevent links 

2. Chevron.com 
  * I took a look at number of company websites which deal in energy resources. They all had the same pattern of a clear, clean look. 
  * All content was centered on the page.  
  * Nothing flashy, just the key links to carefully chosen topics. 
  * Content centered on the webpage, with white background 

3. BP.com 
  * BP's website had a similar layout to Chevron, and Exxon's. 
  * All content is centered on the webpage, with white background. 
   

4. Exxon.com 
  * content centered on screen with light gray background 
  * simple layout with most content located in the navigation bar at the top of the webpage. 
  * Large clickable pictures stacked vertically allow the user to select what interests them. 
  * Footer has minimal information.
